# Code-Club-Python

Welcome to the Code Club Python Repository. Here, you will be able to showcase your projects and other works done through Python! This will also be the repository where assignment answers will be posted. 

If you are unsure about a question, do the following:
1. Ask a friend
2. Check the answer key
3. If you still do not understand, ask one of us (Aiyan or Krish)

Do not copy from the answer key. We want you to understand the material. It is a little tough, but eventually, you will learn it all. This will be very useful when you are making projects. We want you to learn!
